EAL1,"Functionally Tested", "Basic level of assurance. Focuses on function testing to ensure the product or system performs its intended functions. It doesn't involve much scrutiny of the design or internal mechanisms."
EAL2,"Structurally Tested","Requires a bit more structured testing, including analysis of security features. It involves an understanding of the product's architecture, but the level of assurance is still quite basic."
EAL3,"Methodically Tested and Checked","Involves a more methodical approach to testing and evaluation. It includes a higher level of scrutiny of the design and security features, checking for vulnerabilities and flaws."
EAL4,"Methodically Designed, Tested, and Reviewed","Requires a comprehensive security analysis. The design and implementation are thoroughly examined, and testing is conducted to ensure security features are both designed and implemented correctly."
EAL5,"Semiformally Designed and Tested","Involves a more formalized security policy model. The product's design, implementation, and testing processes are more rigorously documented and scrutinized, and there's a higher level of security assurance."
EAL6,"Semiformally Verified Design and Tested","Requires a semiformally verified design, meaning that a mathematical proof or formal method is applied to validate the correctness of the design. Extensive testing is also performed."
EAL7,"Formally Verified Design and Tested","Represents the highest level of assurance. Involves a formal verification of the security features and design, typically using formal methods or mathematical proofs. It demands the highest level of scrutiny and assurance."
