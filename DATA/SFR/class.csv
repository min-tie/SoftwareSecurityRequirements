FAU, Security audit, "Security auditing involves recognizing, recording, storing, and analyzing information related to  security relevant activities (i.e. activities controlled by the TSF). The resulting audit records can  be examined to determine which security relevant activities took place and whom (which user)  is responsible for them."
FCO, Communication, "This class provides two families specifically concerned with assuring the identity of a party  participating in a data exchange. These families are related to assuring the identity of the  originator of transmitted information (proof of origin) and assuring the identity of the recipient  of transmitted information (proof of receipt). These families ensure that an originator cannot  deny having sent the message, nor can the recipient deny having received it. Figure 14 shows the  decomposition of the class."
FCS, Cryptographic support, "The TSF may employ cryptographic functionality to help satisfy several high-level security  objectives. These include, but are not limited to: identification and authentication, nonrepudiation, trusted path, trusted channel, and data separation. This class is used when the TOE  implements cryptographic functions, the implementation of which can be in hardware, firmware  and/or software.  The FCS: Cryptographic support class is composed of four families."
FDP, User data protection,"This class contains families specifying requirements related to protecting user data. FDP: User  data protection is split into four groups of families (listed below) that address user data within a  TOE, during import, export, and storage as well as security attributes directly related to user data."
FIA, Identification and authentication,"Families in this class address the requirements for functions to establish and verify a claimed user  identity.  Identification and authentication are required to ensure that users are associated with the proper  security attributes  The unambiguous identification of authorized users and the correct association of security  attributes with users and subjects is critical to the enforcement of the intended security policies.  The families in this class deal with determining and verifying the identity of users, determining  their authority to interact with the TOE, and with the correct association of security attributes for  each authorized user. Other classes of requirements are dependent upon correct identification  and authentication of users in order to be effective."
FMT, Security management, "This class is intended to specify the management of several aspects of the TSF: security attributes,  TSF data and functions. The different management roles and their interaction, such as separation  of capability, can be specified."
FPR, Privacy,"This class contains privacy requirements. These requirements provide a user protection against  discovery and misuse of identity by other users."
FPT, Protection of the TSF, "This class contains families of functional requirements that relate to the integrity and  management of the mechanisms that constitute the TSF and to the integrity of TSF data. Although  families in this class appear to duplicate components in the FDP: User data protection class, and  they can be implemented using the same mechanisms. However, FDP: User data protection  focuses on user data protection, while FPT: Protection of the TSF focuses on TSF data protection.  In fact, Components from the FPT: Protection of the TSF class are necessary to provide  requirements that the SFPs in the TOE cannot be tampered with or bypassed."
FRU, Resource utilization, "This class provides three families that support the availability of required resources such as  processing capability and/or storage capacity. The family Fault Tolerance provides protection  against unavailability of capabilities caused by failure of the TOE. The family Priority of Service  ensures that the resources will be allocated to the more important or time-critical tasks and  cannot be monopolized by lower priority tasks. The family Resource Allocation provides limits  on the use of available resources, therefore preventing users from monopolizing the resources."
FTA, TOE access, "This family specifies functional requirements for controlling the establishment of a user's session. "
FTP, Trusted path or channels, "Families in this class provide requirements for a trusted communication path between users and the TSF, and for a trusted communication channel between the TSF and other trusted IT products."
